## Project Overview

For this first major individual project, you're going to develop your very *own* personal website! This site is meant to be all about you. Your teacher will give you more definite guidelines about what kinds of content should be included and what specific requirements you'll need to achieve, but the deliverables below will give you a better idea of what constitutes the project's major structure.

## Deliverables 

 - [ ] Design system in Figma <br />
 - [ ] Prototype from Figma <br />
 - [ ] At least three separate, linked HTML documents with specific focal points <br />
 - [ ] Fully functioning site deployed to Github Pages **[IFF your teacher permits/dictates this]** <br />

|                 | The design system generated in Figma is present and identifiable in the final site           |                  |
|                 | The design system utilizes best practices from the course to create visual heirarchy         |                  |
|                 | The developed version of the site matches the proposed version from the prototype            |                  |
|                 | The deployed/final version of the site contains no bugs that impact UX                       |                  |
